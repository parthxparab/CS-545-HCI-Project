We have created an application that lets users track their job applications while it’s in the various stages of process namely after the user has “applied”, it moves on to “interview” stage that might either be Hackerrank assessments, HireVues, 30min phone interviews or an invite to the superday. The application is then moved to either a “reject” or “accept” column where the final offers or rejection emails are sent. 

This project was built keeping HCI Concepts in mind so that it is very easy for the user to use and move around and accessible to a variety of users.
